## Data Scientist's toolbox

The course introduces us to **R Language** and **RStudio** along with the idea of *version control*. The important stuff related to version control are:  
- Git  
- Github  

Git is the version control software and Github is its online interface.  

### Markdown files  

Another important new thing I learned is Markdown file. I use this markdown file to demonstrate how we can insert code chunk in a markdown file.




```{r}
print("Markdown files rule")
```
  
  **Thanks!**
